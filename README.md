# Cryptography
This repository is going to include different cryptography learned.

The first notebook Gaby_cypher uses the methodology of the famous ceasar cipher but I used my nickname to create my own cypher.
The first set of the code shows the traditional ceasar cypher with a shift 4. It encrypts and decrypts the message.
The second set of the code in the notebook, I am using a classical cipher to create my own. 
By printing the encrypting, I am able to see the new calendar.
